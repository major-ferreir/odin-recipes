		<h1>20 Minute Sausage Pasta</h1>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>8 ounces penne pasta</li>
			<li>2 Italian chicken sausages, such as Aidell's®</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
			<li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>12 ounces marinara sauce</li>
			<li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
			<li>freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Preparation</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add pasta, and cook until tender with a bite, 9 to 11 minutes, or according to package directions. Reserve about 1/4 cup pasta water; drain.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, slice chicken sausages in half, then slice each half into small bite-sized pieces.</li>
			<li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and add sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
			<li>Add butter and garlic to the skillet; cook until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Add marinara sauce and cream to the skillet. Cook until combined and completely warmed through; stir in pasta. If saice is too thick, thin with a little pasta water.</li>
			<li>Remove from heat and add in as much Parmesan as you like. Serve in deep bowls with bread to scoop up the extra sauce.</li>
